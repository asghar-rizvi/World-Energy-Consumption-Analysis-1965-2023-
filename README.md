## Introduction
Energy consumption is a key indicator of economic and societal progress. This project investigates the changes in energy consumption across different countries and regions over nearly six decades.

## Data
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes energy consumption data for countries and regions from 1965 to 2023. The data is available in CSV format and includes various columns for energy consumption metrics.

## Setup
To set up and run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asghar-rizvi/World-Energy-Consumption-Analysis-1965-2023.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd World-Energy-Consumption-Analysis-1965-2023
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Analysis
The analysis is conducted in the Jupyter Notebook `World_Energy_Consumption_Analysis.ipynb`. This notebook includes:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Descriptive Statistics
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Growth Rate Calculation
- Trend Analysis

## Visualizations
The notebook contains various visualizations, including:
- **Bar Plots**: Show top countries by energy consumption in 2023.
- **Line Plots**: Illustrate trends over time.
- **Scatter Plots**: Depict growth rates and other metrics.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis include:
- The top countries by energy consumption in 2023.
- Growth rates of energy consumption over the years.
- Trends in energy consumption by region and country.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into global energy consumption trends and highlights disparities between different regions and countries. It serves as a resource for understanding historical and current energy usage patterns.
